# UX-Designs
This repository contains my prototype for a two-week university project in my Data Analytics class!

The task was to elaborate the user problem and design a data (science) product for the following user statement:
“I am a passionate camper and love touring the world in my VW bus. I prefer traveling in good weather, so I often choose my destinations based on the weather conditions. What becomes cumbersome is planning the route according to the weather, as I might have to re re-plan frequently. Each time, I have to search for new campsites with good Google reviews what is quite time time-consuming.”

My solution is a app which displays all weather information and campsite ratings at a glance and sends out timely push notifications when the weather is about to change.
